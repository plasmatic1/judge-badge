# judge-badge

Online judge rating SVG badges.

Note: perviously this was written in Python, but due to the lack of a badgen alternative for Python, I've decided to rewrite this in JS just to see how it would turn out :)

This is quite overengineered, but hey that's just how things are sometimes :D

## TODO

* Add other judges
  * Codeforces, Atcoder, Topcoder
* Bugtesting and unit tests :) (mostly just for fetch rating functions)
* Dockerize this!!!
