# judge-badge

Online judge rating SVG badges.

_Note: perviously this was written in Python, but due to the lack of a badgen alternative for Python, I've decided to rewrite this in JS just to see how it would turn out since I don't really have much experience in JS :)_

This is quite overengineered, but hey that's just how things are sometimes.  Wanna make sure things are running buttery smooth :D

## TODO

* Bugtesting and unit tests :) (mostly just for fetch rating functions)
* Find an empty background atcoder logo (maybe)
* Roll out my own assets instead of using preexisting ones probably :)
* Dockerize this!!!
